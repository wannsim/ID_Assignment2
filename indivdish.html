        <h3>About the dish: </h3>
        <pre class = "aboutInfo">
          Chinese-style fried rice is a dish that is widely consumed in China 
          and around the world.It is believed to have originated in the 
          southern Chinese city of Guangzhou (Canton) in the late 19th century,
           where it was created as a way to use up leftover rice from the previous 
          day. The dish soon became popular among Chinese immigrants in Southeast
          Asia, and from there,it spread to the rest of the world. 
          The basic ingredients for Chinese fried rice include rice, soy sauce, 
          egg, scallions, a protein such as chicken, beef, or shrimp. Over time,
          different regional variations of the dish have emerged, incorporating
          local ingredients and flavours. Today, Chinese-style fried rice is
          considered a staple dish in many households and is widely available at 
          Chinese restaurants around the world.
